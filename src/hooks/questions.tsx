    question: "When is the best time to go on safari in Uganda?",
    answer:
      "Uganda can be visited at any time. Mountain gorilla trekking is on most touristsâ€™ itineraries and permits are available throughout the year.  Uganda is a tropical country with lots of rainfall. The wettest months are March to May and these months can be problematic to travel in. During these Wet season months, some lodges close down and some roads become very muddy and hard to negotiate. The Dry season months of June to August and December to February offer the easiest travel conditions and these months are also recommended",

    question: "Why visit Uganda, what are the major attractions?",
    answer:
      "Uganda is mostly known for its mountain gorilla tourism and most people visiting Uganda will include a gorilla trekking experience in their itinerary. It is possible to go on a Uganda gorilla tour as an add-on to an East African safari in Kenya or Tanzania, but Uganda has lots more to offer, so consider visiting some of the savannah reserves and tracking chimpanzees as well. Queen Elizabeth National Park offers a variety of activities such as chimpanzee trekking in Kyambura Gorge and a boat trip on Kazinga Channel. The wildlife is diverse and one of the highlights is the tree-climbing lions in the Ishasha sector of the park. Murchison Falls National Park offers excellent wildlife viewing as well as spectacular scenic beauty. You can take a boat trip on the Nile River to the famous Murchison Falls or to the delta. The latter is particularly rewarding for birders, and sightings of the prehistoric shoebill are very common in this area. More remote is Kidepo Valley National Park. This park offers a true wilderness experience and is home to many species that donâ€™t occur elsewhere in the country, including the graceful cheetah. Primate lovers should visit Kibale National Park as it offers the most reliable chimpanzee trekking in the country, and a special habituation program is available for visitors wanting to spend a full day with their closest relatives.",

    question: "How safe is Uganda for tourists?",
    answer:
      "Today Uganda is a safe destination. The north of the country has had periods of instability, but these issues are mostly in the past. It is, however, recommended that you get local advice on the current safety situation before heading into the Karamoja region and Kidepo Valley National Park.  As is the case in any developing country, petty crime is a concern in urban centers, and visitors should take normal safety precautions when visiting cities and avoid travelling at night. All national parks have security police to maintain the safety of all visitors.",
